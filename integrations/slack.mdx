Our Slack app adds the `@Empirical` bot to your Slack workspace. This bot
shares test reports in the channel, and tagging the bot will start agent sessions.

## Installation

1. Navigate to the [Integrations](https://dash.empirical.run/integrations) page on our dashboard
2. Click on "Install" on the Slack app to start the OAuth flow

## Configuration

After installation, pick a channel in your Slack workspace where you want to see test reports and/or start agent sessions.

1. Navigate to this Slack channel
2. Add the `@Empirical` bot to this invite: mentioning the bot should do it
3. Run a slash command to link this channel, by sending this message in Slack

    ```
    /empirical link repo-tests
    ```

## Permissions

The Slack app can send and read messagesÂ only in channels where the bot has been added. Specifically, it requests for these permission scopes:

| Scope | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `chat:write`, `chat:write.customize` | Used to share test run reports and AI agent responses |
| `app_mentions:read` | Bot listens to `@Empirical` mentions to start AI chat sessions |
| `reactions:write` | Add reactions to messages to acknowledge that agent is working |
| `channels:history`, `groups:history` | Read message threads to get context in threads where `@Empirical` is mentioned, in public and private channels |
| `commands` | Add slash commands for common actions, like subscribing to test reports and triggering new runs |
