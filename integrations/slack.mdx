Our Slack app adds the `@Empirical` bot to your Slack workspace. This bot
shares test reports in the channel, and tagging the bot will start agent sessions.

## Installation

1. Navigate to the [Integrations](https://dash.empirical.run/integrations) page on our dashboard
2. Click on "Install" on the Slack app to start the OAuth flow

## Configuration

After installation, pick a channel in your Slack workspace where you want to see test reports and/or start agent sessions.

1. Navigate to this Slack channel
2. Add the `@Empirical` bot to this invite: mentioning the bot should do it
3. Run a slash command to link this channel, by sending this message in Slack

    ```
    /empirical link repo-tests
    ```
