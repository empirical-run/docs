The CLI package is @empiricalrun/test-gen and is [hosted on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@empiricalrun/test-gen).

```sh
npx @empiricalrun/test-gen help
```

## Pre-requisites

- Ensure that you have Node.js 20+ installed.
- Ensure you have an account on [our dashboard](https://dash.empirical.run/). If your team uses Empirical, signing in with your work email should just work.

## Authenticate

Use the `login` command to link the CLI with your authenticated session on the dashboard.

```sh
npx @empiricalrun/test-gen login
```

To check your login status, you can use `whoami`.

```sh
npx @empiricalrun/test-gen whoami
```

## Clone your repo locally

To access, which repos you have access to, run the `repos` command.

```sh
npx @empiricalrun/test-gen repos
```

Pick a repo that you want to clone locally, and run the `setup` command. This will clone the repo, and install dependencies.

```sh
npx @empiricalrun/test-gen setup --repo-name REPO_NAME
```
