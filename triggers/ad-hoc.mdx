## Dashboard

You can trigger a new test run from the [dashboard](https://dash.empirical.run/). Head over to the "test runs" page and select an environment to run on.

## From Slack

Once you have the [Slack app](../integrations/slack) installed, you can use this slash command to trigger a new run for your environment. Specify the `repo-name` and `environment-name` inputs.

```
/trigger-tests repo-name environment-name
```
